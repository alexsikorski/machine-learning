# YouTube Data ML
With use of my own data set of top YouTube videos and a multiple linear regression model, values of future video features are estimated.
### Notes
* transform_data.py has been modified as to utilise all data and create a larger data set.
* Data folder is not provided as it generated by another repository, transform_to_data_set.py simply opens generated pickle files, checks for duplicates and creates a data set that can be used.
* The pickle files in the data folder have been filtered out to only contain the following features; title, tags, views, comments, likes and dislikes.
### Usage
The following instructions are only relevant if data set is not provided (it is):
1. Run *transform_data.py* to transform relative json files (obtained from youtube-covid-metrics), newly generated pickle files are of a different format so this is necessary.
2. Run *transform_to_data_set.py* to produce a data set from previously generated pickle files.

Using the data set for multiple linear regression machine learning:
1. Run multiple_linear_regression.py

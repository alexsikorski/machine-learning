# YouTube Data ML
With use of my own data set of top YouTube videos and a multiple linear regression model, values of future video features are estimated.
## What's being used
- Python 3.8
- Pandas
- Sklearn
- Matplotlib
## Notes
* **transform_data.py** has been modified as to utilise all data and create a larger data set.
* Data folder is not provided as [it is generated by another repository](https://github.com/alexsikorski/youtube-data-ml), **transform_to_data_set.py** simply opens generated pickle files, checks for duplicates and creates a data set that can be used.
* The algorithm uses selected features that can be used to predict video views; comments, duration, definition, licensedContent, likes, dislikes, views and/or channelId. 
## How to run
The following instructions are only relevant if data set is not provided (it is):
1. Run **transform_data.py** to transform relative json files (obtained from youtube-covid-metrics), newly generated pickle files are of a different format so this is necessary.
2. Run **transform_to_data_set.py** to produce a data set from previously generated pickle files.

Using the data set for multiple linear regression machine learning:
1. Run **multiple_linear_regression.py**, this will output an R^2 score and display a 3D illustration of predicted plots and actual plots.

## Configurations
If you would like to utilise channelId's as dummy variables:
```python
data, contain_channelId = load_data(False) # change this to True
```

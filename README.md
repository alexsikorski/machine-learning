# Machine Learning Temperature
A script that utilizes a linear regression model and simple generated data to estimate temperature.

### Notes
Data is generated, noise is added to help simulate a real data set. Generated data is used to train the model.

The data resembles the temperature of celsius and fahrenheit where y = 1.8x + 32.

The optimal coefficient would be 1.8 and the optimal intercept would be 32.

### Important Notes
* Data folder is not provided as it generated by another repository, transform_to_data_set.py simply opens generated pickle files, checks for duplicates and creates a data set that can be used.
* The pickle files in the data folder have been filtered out to only contain the following features; title, tags, views, comments, likes and dislikes.
